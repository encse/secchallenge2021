# Lost & Found
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium-gray)

Hey!

I've found a locked laptop in the elevator this morning, though I think I know the guy, who it belongs to.

If I'm right, one of those new wave, influencer pentesters left it there, who think can hack the NASA just because they saw every episode of Mr. Robot. Pathetic...

Anywho... here's the laptop, I have more important things to do right now, but I'm sure you'll find something interesting on there.

Note: This is **not** a web challenge

Hint: The flag is scattered and you have to find all **three parts** of it.
