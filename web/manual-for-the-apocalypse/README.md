ACME Inc? Anti-apocalypse machines? 

That sounds interesting, maybe you could get the manual for the machine that could help you understand how it works and build your own. The wastes could be saved. Time to get the manual.

As you proceed to fetch the manual for the machine you wandered into the headquarters of ACME Inc. There you find a machine that handles the manuals for their products. Unfortunately, it asks for a license number, but you don't have that. But you need to get that manual. DO YOUR THING!
