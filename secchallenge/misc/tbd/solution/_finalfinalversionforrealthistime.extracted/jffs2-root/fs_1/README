I hate coming up with flags, they always sound lame. So with this challenge I wanted to make the perfect flag. I may have gone a bit overboard though... Anyways I wrote all the flag candidates under /pi/flags/ folder in multiple files, so I can organize them, and select the best one. Sadly I now realize, that I accidentally overwrote the perfect flag, and I can't remember it. Luckily I can remember that I wrote it in the file "flag404" on the 5. line at exactly 1612346514 unix time. I must have overwritten it later, because I can't find it anymore. Can you help me?
