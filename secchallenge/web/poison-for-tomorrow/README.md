You did it! Everything blew up. Joe is dead, the remaining Warboys ran off. Luckily the anti-apocalypse machine is unharmed. As you walk closer to the machine you see it is counting down from 999 years. Joe programmed it to delay the end of the apocalypse as much as possible. Find a way to reprogram the machine, otherwise, the apocalypse will stay for a long time.
