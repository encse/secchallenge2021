# Conundrum at El Nit Patroon Rico
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/legend-gray)

\* A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... \*

Company headquarters, *El Nit Patroon Rico*:

**[A]** In order to satisfy our shareholders, we need a piece of the hardware to be invisible to the user and really hard to tamper. Any ideas?

**[B]** Mm. We should put another CPU onto the motherboard, load proprietary code on it and make sure the boot0 rom checks digital signatures on that.

**[A]** Sounds so orwellian when you say it Billy. I love it. Any way this could go wrong?

**[B]** Maybe. But we can put more obscurity around it, I have a few ideas. Huffman compression with unknown dictionaries burned into boot0, hardware fuses, no documentation.

**[A]** Fascinating, I will present it to the board of directors. *El Nit Patroon Rico* will be great again, thanks to you Billy.
