# Roguelike
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/legend-gray)

I decided to create a new roguelike game. It is far from being complete, but it is at least playable. Here is a debug build, if you want to give it a try.

`nc challenges.crysys.hu 5008`

*Hint: look for the functions in the `roguelike` namespace; the other namespaces belong to the Rust runtime, you shouldn't need to look into those.*
