![](https://img.shields.io/badge/easy-gray)

A freshly downloaded flag-dispenser from The Pirate Bay, the only thing you need is a valid serial key. The description said it's not a virus and they NEVER lie, ignore the comments.

**All jokes aside the executable is NOT malicious, however Windows Defender or other AVs might pop an alert.**
