We have a friend, Xenia Laurencia Maria. She is very cool, but sometimes annoying, but mostly cool. She likes to answer with riddles and tasks to our every question. Yesterday we asked her for a password only she knows. She responded with a very large excel sheet... A classic. We've executed it and it does no harm, but runs very slowly. Could you please acquire the password?
