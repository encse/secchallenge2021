**[B]** Josh, I also found an old cartridge in the treatment facility. Apparently, WaterWorks LLC was not just about cleansing, they were developing games on the side.

**[J]** What kind of cartridge?

**[B]** I don't know what kind, it looks ancient! Never seen anything like it. According to their market analysis, people love retro games but it's really hard to sell due to emulators and roms being widely available.. Rampant Piracy. 

**[J]** What a bunch of bollocks. People pay for the games they like regardless of DRM!

**[B]** Whatever. The booklet mentions they made a new DRM scheme to allow retro games to rise again. I didn't see any development units of the console but at least the cartridge is intact.

**[J]** Can you.. connect to it somehow?

**[B]** Yeah, I'll try to pull a rom dump and send it over.

**[J]** Alright, it's my time to shine then, good work Bill.
