As you wake up, the first thing you notice is a headache.
The second one is that you are in the back of a vehicle you do not remember entering.
You hear unfamiliar voices outside. Something about an "important device" and "the apocalypse".
While it sounds fairly interesting, you can't make out the details.

Sitting up, you notice something on your legs.
No one seems to be around, so You are free to take a closer look.
It looks like a fancy cuff.
On the device, You notice what appears to be a connector, labeled **UART**...

Note: If you believe to have successfully connected, but receive no feedback from the device, you might want to ask it to help you.
