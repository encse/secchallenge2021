- Hey, Nux! Look at this crystal! It's almost as nice as a V8 engine!
- What?
- It looks like... a chrome... thingy.
- What are you talking about. Let me see.
- NO! ITS MINE! I... MUST... DRAW!
```

One of Nux's weirdo friend found a mesmerizing crystal in the desert. After taking it with him, he got posessed with it. He tells weird jokes no one understands, and draws a lot on his shitty computer using an unrecognizeable graphic tablet as old as mankind. However, he won't let you see the drawings, thus, you installed a packet sniffer on his computer. 

You managed to get a pcap of one of his drawing. He starts every session by calibrating the graphic tablet. This is achieved by drawing a horizontal and a vertical line, pushing the tip of the pen (draw force calibration), and tilting the pen around.

Your task is to recover the picture he drew.
