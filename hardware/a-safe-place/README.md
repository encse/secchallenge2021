V8? What did they mean by leaving V8 behind on the ACME servers? Perhaps the war boys deleted the manual? They must have a copy of it! Wait a minute... I remember that Joe has a little home made safe in his room. Maybe its in there?

You examine the safe, and there is a display on the front, a dial and two buttons. It feels like that the whole thing is made out of scrap electronics. The dial rotates like a rotary encoder, and the thing beeps as you press the buttons. You managed to take the cover off the dial and the `next` button. Bingo! You can see the rotary encoder and the button's connectors. You hook up your trusty logic analyzer, and wait for Joe to unlock it. After a few hours, you managed to log the signals while the safe has been opened, but it looks like the encoder is not the best quality. 

Your task is to figure out the code and open the safe. The counter starts from 0. After you figure out the code, you can use the webpage to enter it on the  safe, and receive the flag.
