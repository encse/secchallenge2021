# SPIcy information
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/hard-gray)

You have successfully captured the communication between a Raspberry Pi and some external chip. You don't know (yet) what the chip does, but it must be something very important. The chip itself is visible on the `chipsetup.jpg` photo, and the communication captured by your logic analyzer is in `everything.sal` (you can open it with [Saleae Logic 2](https://ideas.saleae.com/f/changelog/)).

*Note: You shouldn't encounter corrupted files, we have had problems unpacking with [jefferson](https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson), so if you run into problems using it, you should just try some other tool or method!*
