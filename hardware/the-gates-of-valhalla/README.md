`We're here! We're finally here! The gates of Valhalla! What an ancient and robust device! I can't believe I'll finally enter Valhalla and join the glorious V8 gang! But how do I open it?`

You've arrived at the gates of Valhalla. Unfortunately, the gates are closed. There is a control board with a bunch of switches next to the door, and a plaque above saying `Only the worthy shall enter the gates of Valhalla`. There is a circuit engraved on the plaque. Weâ€™ve attached it as a picture to this challenge. Can you open the gates of Valhalla?
