la.the wasteland.day.
flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move
through an eerie, barren land. the only sound is the
howl of a rising wind.
ahead something looms out of the storm. as we approach
we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil
pump.
the wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old
man. this is the narrator:

we soar along the empty highway up and down its rises
and around its curves until we are out in the vast
wasteland.
3.
wasteland.
day.
the black hole of the supercharger dominates the frame.
behind the wheel we see max looking about 3 years older.
he is gaunt, unkept - his leathers tattered and torn.
the black-on-black pursuit car, bearing the scars of
numerous road duels, cruises down the roller coaster
highway.
as max crests a hill he hits the brakes. his companion,
a mongrel dog, sitting in a baby's auto seat, lifts its
head to look.
the black-on-black slides to a stop.
4.rural shack 0n highway.
day.
page 6/71on a ridge close to the road, silhouetted in a
dust-blown field, is a strange assortment of warrior
like men. they are cannibalizing a farm vehicle:
siphoning its fuel and loading food and other loot into
their bizarre vehicles.
the dog growls. max looks further along the ridge. on
the horizon we see a burning wooden shack and three
bodies strung from a gnarled, dead tree.
max looks back to the men. several of them, having seen
him, are running to their vehicles.
the first of them is a muscular man with a red mohawk
haircut - he is heavily protected by a leather and metal
chest plate, shoulder pads and leggings. this is wez.
he runs to where a golden youth sits on the pillion seat
of a huge bike.
wez is followed by two more mohawkers on bikes, three
gayboy berserkers in road racers and four smegma crazies
in bizarre dune buggies.
max guns the big motor. the black-on-black takes off.
max hits the supercharger - surging away..
through the rear window we see wez lead the other nine
vehicles down the hill, giving chase...
wipe.
5.elsewhere on the highway.
(a little later).
day.
high angle helicopter shot of the chase. the marauders'
vehicles are strung down the highway. only the fastest,
led by wez, can keep up with the black-on-black.
wipe.
6.the wrecks on the highway.
(still later).
day.
the black-on-black surges around a wide curve, revealing
only three vehicles still in pursuit.
the first machine is wez's big road bike, the golden
youth riding pillion. it is followed by a bizarre road
racer and a strange dune buggy.
as the black-on-black crests a rise max is confronted by
a tangle of wrecked vehicles on the road ahead.
he swerves, slaloms through the wrecks and accelerates
into a sweeping right hand curve.
wez ramps his bike over the first wreck and corrects,
avoiding the other wrecks.
the road racer ramps two wheels over the first wreck but
cannot correct. it clips the second wreck. sends it
spinning, then continues after the black-on-black.
the dune buggy decides to avoid the wrecks altogether
page 7/71and veers off the road to the right. it heads across
open terrain aiming to intercept the black-on-black on
the curve.
7.the marauders catch up - highway.
day.
a light flashes on max's dashboard, an alarm whoops.
max looks down at the fuel gauge: close to empty. he
curses and flicks a switch, cutting off the
supercharger.
the black-on-black slows ...
the dog whimpers, crawls off its chair and under max
seat.
wez overhauls max on the passenger side, he raises his
forearm, aiming his gauntlet-style crossbow at max's
head.
max barely has time to glimpse the road racer drawing
alongside the driver's door.
the passenger - a gayboy berserker - wields a brutal,
gas-powered 'gun': the heads of six metal arrows
protrude from a big barrel. this weapon is the
"porta-pak".
max hits the brakes.
the road racer and the bike surge past the black car...
just as the porta-pak fires.
two arrows thud into the black car, three go astray and
one hits wez in the arm.
max throws the black car in behind the road racer ...
wez, fighting to control the bike, leaves the road...
max changes down and hits the supercharger...
the black car leaps forward, ramming into the back of
the road racer, bullying it along.
wheels and metal screaming, the two cars approach an
intersection littered with furniture and other debris.
a road rig lies abandoned on the roadside.
max eases back for a moment then flattens the
accelerator...
the black car slams into the back of the road racer...
hurling it forward, just as the dune buggy regains the
highway...
8.
the intersection.
day.
the driver of the road racer screams as his vehicle hits
the dune buggy, spinning it like a top, sending it
crashing into the side of the road rig.
the road racer slides through a 180 degrees, rolls,
smashes through a road sign and hits a power pole.
page 8/71the pole thuds to the road as max throws a handbrake "u"
turn and skids to a halt in the middle of the
intersection.
max, carrying a jerry can, gets out of the black car.
he looks down the highway.
9.
a rise overlooking the intersection.
day.
wez is stopped on the crest of the road, looking down on
the intersection. the arrow is still in his arm.
we see the golden youth clearly for the first time: he
is strikingly beautiful.
10.
the intersection.
max, unfazed , hurries to the wreck of the dune buggy,
crushed beneath the road rig. fuel streams from its
ruptured tank.
from inside the wreck we hear the moans of the injured
driver.
max puts the jerry can under the escaping fuel and -
tearing a bandana from his neck - mops up the gasolene
lying on the bitumen.
suddenly, there is a shrill whistle.
max looks up at the crest of the road.
11.
the rise overlooking the intersection.
day.
wez grins as he pulls the arrow slowly out of.his arm.
his eyes never leave max.
he holds up the arrow and wez mouths the words:
for you!
with that he puts the arrow back into his quiver and
guns the motor. he reals the font wheel, hangs there a
moment, then spins the bike around and roars back to the
wasteland.
12.
the intersection.
max, examines the road rig: most of the tyres have been
punctured with arrows, the rear doors torn off and its
contents pillaged.
max taps the.fuel tank - empty.
he reaches up to open the door of the cabin ...
there is an anguished scream. max turns.
the hand of the dying driver emerges from the twisted
metal of the dune buggy.
the fingernails score deeply into the paintwork, a rush
of dark blood pours out of the wreck. then, silence.
max opens the cabin door ...
a figure drops down, crashing onto his shoulders. as
max struggles from its grasp we see that it is the
page 9/71bloated putrefying corpse of the rig's driver. two
crossbow bolts are buried in its neck.
max stoops and picks up a toy hurdy-gurdy which has
fallen from the dead man's hand.
as he walks back towards the black-on-black he turns the
handle, playing the first few notes of "happy birthday".
he stops next to the vehicle, in the middle of the
intersection. he looks from one direction to another
... undecided ... and then sees the smashed road sign.
he picks up a fragment which reads:
one tree hill:
and throws it into the air.
it lands at his feet, pointing north.
he gets into the car and drives off in that direction.
fade to black.
13.
desert road.
next morning.
the-black-on-black travels slowly through the shimmering
desert. the only sounds are the rumble of the engine
and the whistle of the wind.
as the car crests a rise max looks ahead and sees a
large kite - in the shape of a man's grinning face
hovering above a dune.
max leaves the dog to guard the car ilnd, carrying a
jerry can and a tyre iron, cautiously makes his way
across the sand.
14.
on the dunes.
day.
from the top of the dune max sees that the kite is
tethered to an abandoned vehicle: a primitive version
of a gyrocopter - little more than a motor, a seat and a
rotor mounted on a chassis.
a set of footprints leads from the gyrocopter, up a dune
and disappears into the distance.
slowly max approaches the vehicle, skirting around it,
looking for a trap. nothing moves except for the
flurries of sand whirling across the dunes.
15.
the gyrocopter.
day.
carefully, max reaches up and taps the gas tank: empty.
as be straightens up, he hears a low hiss.
max freezes. only inches away a snake, coiled around
the vertical shaft of the gyro, is poised to strike...
they stare at each other.
the snake strikes... max springs.. hand flashing ...
catching it by the neck.
page 10/71he holds up the snake, grinning, about to kill it.
the head and shaft of an arrow emerge from the sand
behind him. it is followed by the frame of a crossbow
and a man's face, spitting sand, a length of rubber hose
clenched in his teeth. this is the gyro captain.
gyro captain:
don't hurt that snake!
max turns. the captain emerges from his shallow grave,
motioning with the crossbow.
gyro captain:
put him back... gently!
max lays the snake on the rotor.
gyro captain:
sounded like a big v-8 to me. i
guess i got myself some guzzolene.
he raises his bow, aiming at max's head, preparing to
fire.
max:
the car's booby-trapped. touch
those tanks and boom! you'll blow
yourself apart.
the captain looks quickly in the direction of the
black-on-black, and back to max. he gestures with the
crossbow.
gyro captain:
drop the weapons... now back up.
max throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster
which contains a sawn-off shotgun. the captain slings
the gunbelt over his shoulder.
16.
the desert road - max's car.day.
max walks backwards towards his car. the captain tense,
crossbow trained on max, follows him across the dune.
gyro captain:
you're quick, i'll give you that.
never seen a man beat a snake.
never. reflexes, that's what you've
got. me? i've got brains.
he taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.
page 11/71gyro captain:
now, where's this booby-trap?
max reaches under the car. his hand groping for a
machete clipped to the chassis. his fingers wrap around
the handle.
gyro captain:
a fella - a quick fella - might keep
a weapon under there.
he nuzzles the bow against the back of max's head.
gyro captain:
then i'd have to pin his head to the
panel.
max slides his hand away, disconnects a series of
mechanical fuses and shows them to the captain. he
moves to open the driver's door. the captain reacts
quickly, raising his bow, motioning max back.
max:
there's one more.
gyro captain:
oh no! you don't play me the fool.
the captain, keeping the crossbow trained on max's head,
opens the door.
the dog flies out, leaping for the captain's throat.
the crossbow discharges, narrowly missing max as he
hurls himself at the captain. the steel arrow buries
itself in the car door.
max pins the captain to the ground and recovers his
shotgun.
max cocks the gun next to the captain's head.
gyro captain:
gas! petrol! guzzolene! listen!
hundreds... thousands of gallons...
as much as you want ...
max eases off the trigger.
max:
where?
page 12/71gyro captain:
not far. ten... maybe twenty
miles. pumping it they are.
refining it. kachunk... kachunk...
kachunk... day and night. a huge
tanker full.
max:
balls!
gyro captain:
it's there, you betcha... i'll tell
you straight though - it's not self
service. it's under guard. too
hard for me. but a man with your
ingenuity ... jesus i reckon...
max rams the barrel against the captain's head.
max:
where?
gyro captain:
kill me, and you'll never find out.
max drags him to his feet and pushes him towards the
black-on-black.
17.
int. max's car.day.
max is driving the black-on-black while the captain sits
rigid in the passenger's seat. the muzzle of the
shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and the
stock fastened to the top of the seat.
a length of wire runs from the trigger across to the dog
sitting in the rear of the car. the end of the wire is
clasped firmly in its mouth.
the captain, not daring to take his eyes off the dog
directs max along back roads to an area of high country.
the dog's eyes dart out the window. he whimpers, body
twitching.
the captain stares in horror at a rabbit bounding
through the scrub.
max smiles to himself.
the dog settles back..
18.
a clifftop overlooking the compound.
day.
max moves towards the cliff edge. a column of smoke
rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant
page 13/71sounds:
war-whoops; and revving motors.
the gyro captain - manacled and guarded by the dog -
hobbles along behind max.
from the top of the cliff max looks down on a battle
raging on the plain below.
a fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch and
coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large gang of
marauders:
buggies, and gayboy berserkers in road racers.
they attack along a road which passes through an area
outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation.
three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral
containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a
newly-ploughed field.
as the marauders' vehicles come within range of the
compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing
crossbows at the defenders ranged along the battlements.
gyro captain:
well... i never said it'd be easy.
max unhooks an old pair of binoculars from the equipment
belt around his waist.
19.the compound.
pov binoculars.
day.
through the binoculars max sees a weird dune buggy
charging towards the camp. he recognizes the two
bizarre occupants as members of the gang he encountered
sacking the farmlet the day before.
the dune buggy races along a causeway which spans the
ditch, heading for a yellow school bus which blocks the
gate of the camp. the passenger in the buggy fires a
string of arrows from a multi-barrel gas-gun.
a warrior woman on the battlement, armed with a flame-
thrower, hits the buggy with a stream of liquid fire.
the blazing vehicle plunges into the ditch. it tumbles
into another wreck which met a similar fate - its tyres
still smouldering.
max pans his binoculars to the interior of the compound.
he sees a large mechanical pump drawing the oil from the
ground and a primitive fractionating column used to
refine it.
a defender firing from the refinery tower is struck by
page 14/71an arrow. he falls over the guard rail, where a dead
companion hangs over the edge, suspended by his foot.
the sound of an amplified voice draws max's attention.
he swings the binoculars around.
20.
the hillside across from the compound.
a huge, muscular man - his face covered by a metal mask
- sits in a bizarre six-wheeled vehicle. he uses a
microphone to shout orders to the marauders, directing
the course of the battle. this man is the humungus.
beside him, is the mohawk biker called wez. he sits
astride his bike, the golden youth clinging to his
waist. he speaks with humungus, pointing, sweeping his
hand.
21.
clifftop.
day.
the gyro captain is becoming more agitated.
gyro captain:
okay, there it is. if anyone can
get. in, i know it's gonna be you.
me ... i've gotta feed the snakes.
max drops the binoculars.
the captain offers his wrists to be unmanacled.
gyro captain:
a man lives by his word, i reckon.
and i've kept mine ...
max gets to his feet and hauls the gyro captain to a
nearby tree stump.
gyro captain:
look! we had a deal: i show you
the gas - you let me go.
max starts to chain him to the stump.
max:
the contract was i wouldn't kill
you.
the gyro captain turns angry, protesting.
max pushes the shotgun close to his face.
max:
i reckon you got a bargain...
you?
the captain shuts up.
don't
page 15/71max tests the chain. the sounds of the battle continue.

22.
cliff top.
later the same day.
max has settled in. he sits under a small camouflage
canopy. his binoculars are fixed on a tripod fashioned
from sticks.
the dog lies nearby. further away the gyro captain is
tethered to the tree stump. on a short-leash.
the black car is covered by a camouflage net.
max leans back from his binoculars, takes a can of dog
food from a pack and begins to open it.
the dog pricks up his ears.
the gyro captain watches as max unwraps a velvet cloth
to reveal a beautiful silver fork.
the revving of engines wafts up from below.
max, spooning the food into his mouth, leans forward to
his binoculars.
23.
the compound.day.
the marauders have formed a bridge of car wrecks across
the ditch near a less defended section of the compound.
at wez's signal, three bikes ride at the bridge of
wrecks. two of them are hit almost immediately but the
third rides over the wrecks and attempts to ramp into
the compound.
the bike flies through the air ... and bounces into the
wire. the rider sails over the fence into the compound,
where he is set upon by three defenders.
24.
cliff top.
day.
max wolfs down his meal.
the gyro captain and the dog lick their lips in unison.
max tosses the can and its remains to the dog.
the captain groans as the dog buries its muzzle into the
can. the captain inches over towards the dog.
the dog snarls ...
wipe.
25.
cliff top.
magic hour.
from the cliff top, we see the lights in the compound
come on. a searchlight weaves across the wasteland.
the only sound is the "kachunk! kachunk!" of the huge
oil pump.
the battle has reached a stalemate. the defenders and
the attackers watch each-other across "no man's land".
smouldering wrecks and dead bodies litter the ditch.
the animals in the corral have been slaughtered.

the dog is asleep.
the gyro captain rings his finger around the dog food

max sits up at the sound of a bugle.
he looks down.
27.
the compound.
magic hour.
the marauders kick over their engines, fanning across
the area under cultivation, tearing up the ploughed
field.
as they pull back to the high ground surrounding the
camp, they set fire to the farm huts and drag off the
carcasses of the dead animals.
the fires blaze fiercely on the darkening plain.
fade to black.
28.
clifftop.
dawn.
tracking close on max as he sleeps.
the dog sitting next to him is on his feet growling at
the sound of vehicles from the plain below.
max wakes, alert, looking down.
below, three compound vehicles are fanning out across
the plain.
the marauders camped on the rise. rouse themselves ...
climbing aboard their vehicles.
the gyro captain, tethered to the stump, strains at his
chain but cannot get close enough to the edge to see ...
gyro captain:
what's up!!
max ignores him, concentrating on the situation below.
the bulk of the marauders have split into three groups
each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. the
humungus leads one of the groups. four marauders,
camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp.
suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and
speeds across the plain towards max's clifftop. it
passes out of sight around the back of the hill.
max hurries from his canopy across the other side of the
hilltop.
29.

morning.
max looks past the black-on-black, to where the lone
compound vehicle has achieved the bitumen.
suddenly, three mohawk bikes and a tow truck emerge from
page 17/71behind a rocky outcrop. led by wez, they fire arrows
into the tyres and smash the windscreen.
the compound vehicle leaves the road, rolling...
as the gyro captain crawls to his side, max raises his
binoculars...

the bloodied driver is being dragged from the wreck by
two mohawkers. the others cannibalize the vehicle and
siphon off its fuel. another occupant emerges from the
twisted metal and tries to crawl away... it is a young
woman.

something deep in the pockets of his great-coat.
he produces a large telescope which is attached to his

the golden youth is sitting on one of the bikes. the

to the panel.
methodically, he reloads and fires another pin into the
man's other shoulder.
max pans the telescope to where the three mohawkers hold
the struggling woman. at wez's signal they start to
tear the woman's clothes away...

his trousers.
close to his back, the camera stops.
he turns, looking up.
max, carrying a pair of bolt cutters is hurrying towards
him.
the mohawker grabs for his crossbow.
maxis foot stamps down, pinning his wrist ... ssswish!
the bolt cutters swing down ... onto the mohawker's
head.
tears stream down the compound man's face.
as max walks up to him we see that he is bleeding badly.
his name is nathan.
nathan:

tracking closer we see that it is a wild-looking child,
about 8 years old. he is dressed in dog skins and
carries a chrome boomerang. on one hand he wears what
looks like a catcher's mitt: a leather glove reinforced
with steel plates. this is the feral kid.

rabbit warren.

nathan! nathan! it's nathan.
a man on the catwalk orders the gate to be opened.
max hurries along the causeway ...
the feral kid comes out of the rabbit warren and begins
to follow max.
a trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the
causeway...
as max approaches the camp, the old yellow school bus is
pulled aside.
the warrior woman emerges, crossbow ready, keeping it
trained on max.
she is followed by another defender - the mechanic's
assistant - pulling a strange mechanized crane.
suspended from the front of this machine is a
paraplegic. he is the mechanic.
they pass max, heading for the car, revealing big
rebecca distraught, running towards him.
big rebecca:
nathan! god have mercy.. what a
waste.
she wipes the man's face, caressing him, as max walks
on.
she turns and looks straight at the camp's leader,
pappagallo. he is standing at the gate, surrounded by
anxious defenders.
big rebecca:
look at your handiwork! they didn't
have a chance ...
one of the group at the gate - a nuggety old man called
the curniudgeon - plays to the crowd, pointing at
pappagalo.

as the defenders part to let max through we see the
group includes:
holding each other tight; a woman butcher, holding a
knife and a rabbit; a middle aged man who looks like a
farmer; and a lusty young girl chewing her finger nails.
warrior woman:
pity your name wasn't pulled out the
hat.
curmudgeon:
we can escape, take our petrol, he
said. how? i said. get a prime
mover, he said ...
he points to nathan who is being carried to an old bread
van. the rear door is open, revealing two
hospital-style beds, drip stands and shelves of medical
supplies. an injured camp member occupies one of the
beds.
curmudgeon:
... and there's the result!
madness i said!
pappagallo ignores him, addressing max:
pappagallo:
where did you find him?
max:
two, three miles away... left for
dead... next to his car. we made a
deal.
in the background the farmer starts to work the first
arrow out of nathan's chest.
big rebecca comforts him.
pappagallo:

max:

an anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking
over max. this is the quiet man.
quiet man:
there was a woman... in the car ...
max looks straight at him.
max:
she's dead.
the man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.
quiet man:
how? what did they do?
max:
it was quick.
the quiet man bows his head and turns away. nathan
groans. angie has the clear plastic mask of an air viva
device over nathan's face. pismo pumps air into his
lungs.
max turns to pappagallo:
max:
i saw a man in trouble and i brought
him in. and now i just want to get
out of here. give me my gas.
warrior woman:
for all we know, he's one of them.
give him nothing.
there's an ugly murmur of agreement.
max, keeping his temper, talks to pappagallo:
max:
we had a contract...
the farmer succeeds in removing the first arrow. big
rebecca relaxes.
nathan sputters. blood sprays into the plastic mask.
big rebecca screams. the feral kid looks on as the
farmer feels for a pulse: nothing.
page 23/71pappagallo turns to max:
pappagallo:
i don't know who you are, or what
happened. but if you had a
contract, it was with him. and it
died with him.
pappagallo turns on his heel and walks through the
crowd, back towards his tent.
the warrior woman puts a bow to max's temple and shoves
him towards the gate.

the feral kid, following max, laughs. the dog snarls at
the boy.
as the crowd parts, max sees that the black-on-black is
being winched through the gate.
the mechanic supervises the work.
max stiffens, furious ...
warrior woman prods him with the bow:
warrior woman:
be thankful, you're still alive.
she pushes him past the car.
the dog trained to protect the vehicle begins to grow.
the mechanic turns to max:
mechanic:

he holds up the detonators and fuse wire.
mechanic:

the mechanic runs an affectionate hand along the bonnet
of the car.
the dog flies at him as he touches the car. the dog's
jaws clamp onto his useless legs, threatening to topple
him from his mechanical "crane".
the assistant turns, wielding a tyre iron, about to
batter the dog to death...
max grabs his arm, wrenching the tyre iron from his
page 24/71hand... other men raise their weapons...
the head of a crossbow arrow cuts into max's neck. the
dog, max and the camp people are frozen, waiting for the
next move.
warrior woman, holding the other end of the bow, motions
him forward.
slowly max bends, and gathers up the dog.
max:
it's ok, dog. just do as they
say...
his words are lost in the wail of a siren. a guard
perched in the watch tower shouts a warning.

rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety.
pappagallo mans the flame thrower. others draw their

the feral kid follows the rabbit down a hole at the foot
of the battlement.
as max climbs to a position on the battlements near
warrior woman and pappagallo he sees that the marauder
horde has gathered in all its glory.

the marauders rumble in formation over the rise.
at their head is the humungus machine surrounded by a
guard consisting of wez and his golden youth on a bike,
a tow truck with two skin heads, a road racer with three
gay boy berserkers and a dune buggy with two smegma
cfazies.
as the advance guard approaches through the dust and
heat haze we see that six near naked and bloodied people
are lashed to the front of the vehicles.
at the big crossbow, the warrior woman aims at the
humungus machine. one of the two victims, tied to the
front of the humungus machine, is screaming above the
awesome rumble of machines and sirens...

the vanguard of 5 vehicles stops on the causeway, just

max and wez look across no man's land, recognisin- each

the toadie, a comically dressed marauder perched on the
top of the humungus vehicle, waves his arms. the
marauders cut their motors ... silence.
the toadie announces:
toadie:
greetings from the lord humungus the
warrior of the wasteland! the
ayatollah of rock and roller.
camera cranes up to the himiungus as he rises in his
seat. his voice is amplified by two loudspeakers
mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle:
humungus:
i am told you wish to take the
gasolene out of the wasteland...
the second victim lashed onto the humungus vehicle
shouts in defiance:

suddenly, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the
barricade and out into the wasteland. wez whirls his
arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a
crossbow bolt.
the feral kid eases back down into his hole.
the toadie bellows:
toadie:
you see! there is no escape. the
humungus rules the wasteland...
defiant victim:
don't give them the gas! blow it

wez leaps from his bike and head-butts the man into
unconsciousness. the broken victim sobs uncontrollably.
the feral boy runs from his hole, screaming. he lets
fly with the chrome boomerang...
the projectile whistles past wez's head and returns to
the kid.
he reaches up and - clunk! catches it in his steel
plated mitten.

arcs and returns to wez ... out of his reach.

he reaches up to catch it...
then falls to his knees clutching his bleeding
fingerless hand.

manacles unlocked now, dangling from one wrist.
he produces the hurdy-gurdy he found on the bloated man
and plays the first few notes of "happy birthday".
from the hole under max, the feral kid appears, wiping
his boomerang. he is attracted by the noise.
max plays the next few notes faster.
the feral kid grins.
more notes - very fast.
the feral kid laughs.
several people at the back of the crowd, including
warrior woman, turn around to look. max holds the
manacles up so that she can see that he's free.

and let us suppose he keeps it ...
the defenders turn to pappagallo, standing on the
page 30/71battlement:
pappagallo:
...and we walk out of here with our
lives. what then? do we wander the
wasteland - scavenging. wake up one
morning and find we're just like
them - savages.
he points in the direction of the marauders.
pappagallo:
is that what you want? i don't. i
came out here and i found that pump.
i built that plant and ploughed that
field. why? because we are human
beings. we must maintain our
dignity. we are not barbarians ...
the crowd is silent ...
pappagallo:
i made one mistake - i waited too
long... thinking we could survive
here. we can't. but, as frightened
as we all are let's not forget one
thing.
he points to the tanker of fuel propped up next tc the
cracking plant ...
pappagallo:
that is more than just a tank of
fuel. it's our lifeline, our
passport to a place beyond the reach
of men on machines.
he talks over several protesting voices ...
pappagallo:
no! i don't know how we're gonna
get there. but the first step is to
defend that fuel. i won't surrender
it to anyone. i stay! alone if i
have to...
big rebrcca:
page 31/71words! just words. you're going to
die, for a pipedream.
big rebecca moves over to join the curmudgeon and the
lusty girl.
warrior woman:
no! we fight for a belief - i stay!
lusty looks straight at pappagallo.
lusty:
i really wished it had worked. i'm
sorry.
the mechanic's assistant starts to push the mechanicis
contraption towards the curmudgeon's group, but the
mechanic resists, grabbing onto the catwalk.
the assistant leaves him there.
angie takes the assistant's place and pushes the
mechanic's contraption over to pappagallo's side.
angie:
we stay!
pismo is left hesitating in the middle. after a
terrible moment of indecision he joins angie.
the camp is now divided, mostly against pappagallo.

prime mover and in return you give
page 32/71me my black car and as much gas as i
can carry. all i need right now is

gallons of petroleum.
they look at him quizzically.

picking his way carefully across rugged ground, max
skirts close to a large campfire.
around it, 4 groups of marauders are carousing; some are
laughing loudly at a victim strung up to a beam by his
wrists. a bottle passes among the marauders. in the
shadows, lit by the flickering flame, a mohawk biker
fondles two camp followers.
closest to max, a gayboy berserker bones his machete on
page 33/71a whetstone.
max skirts round him, not taking his eyes off him.
suddenly max's leg gives way, caught in a rabbit hole.
he pitches forward, the jerry cans thumping together.
the gayboy berserker pivots... listening... knife

crossing the dunes in his buggy, he happened across the
gyrocopter. he left his buggy, walked down to the
abandoned gyrocopter and fell victim to the snake. he
staggered around in circles before slumping face down in
the sand.
the captain lets out a whoop as he and max half stumble,
half run towards the body.
captain:

killers. the snake's fangs, my

the captain stops, staring down at the body of the
snake, its head crushed.
quickly he picks it up and begins to skin it, muttering.
captain:
don't think you're gonna get any of
this. cos you're not. it was my
snake. i found it. i trained it.
and i'm gonna eat it.
keeping the gun trained on the captain, max rummages
through the marauder's clothes. he finds a necklace of
spark plugs, bolts, teeth and two old shotgun
cartridges.
max removes the two cartridges. one crumbles apart.
the second, although dog-eared, remains intact.
the gyro captain looks up as max cracks open the shotgun
- both barrels are empty.
max shoves the dog-eared cartridge into the barrel and
quickly snaps the shotgun shut.
the gyro captain gasps:
captain:

that's dishonest!
max nudges the captain towards the gyrocopter.
the captain stands fast, eyeing the shotgun ...

on seeing this max grabs the shotgun, shoves it through
the smashed front window of the truck and fires...
the gun fizzes and pops - the cartridge was a dud. max
ducks and yanks down hard on the wheel...
the humungus fires. the big gun kicks ...
the front of the prime mover bursts with steam and hot
oil.
the big machine careers off the road, and through a
primitive tent. as the canvas rips away... we glimpse
two startled marauders in the throes of hetereosexual
love.
max recovers, the big machine keeps going, rocketing
down the hill 400 yards from the causeway ...
page 38/71suddenly a powerful arm bursts through the driver's
window... and grabs max around the throat - it's wez!
the dog attacks wez, clamping his jaw around his
gauntlet.
wez pulls the dog out the window and flicks his arm.
the dog sails through the air ...

max rams his elbow into wez's face.
the big biker holds on, tightening his grip.
a dune buggy with a machine gun like crossbow - the
4-pak - fires four bolts into the tyres. all but one
tyre on the driver's side blow out.
as the prime mover charges past, we track with the lone
wolf, who drives a two-engined assault car.
he yells to other marauders behind:
lone wolf:
the gate's open! follow me in!
a street car and a dune buggy surge up beside him.
in the background we see the dog, running along the
road, trying to catch up to the tanker.
81. the airborne gyrocopter. day.
the gyro captain curses and screams.
gyro captain:
don't lose it now! we need the fuel!
the captain grabs whatever he can find - the two jerry
cans and his chains and throws them at the chase below.
82. the approach to the causeway. day.
two of the objects fall across the path of the on-
rushing street car ... the third smashes into the
vehicle's windscreen - to no avail, the vehicle
continues in the chase to the causeway... converging on
the prime mover.
the 4-pak dune buggy surges up to the driver's side
wheels...the smegma crazie has reloaded the crossbow and
is taking aim on the critical last tyre.

the gyro captain is reaching down into a sack ... he
pulls out two snakes. clamping their jaws shut, he
kisses them goodbye and hurls them down...

...the snakes land in the 4-pak dune buggy - one of them
between the driver's legs.. perplexed, he reaches downn

he screams... the snake has its fangs in his hand ...
85. the causeway. day.
the 4-pak dune buggy swerves out of control... up and
over the back of the prime mover... and onto the street
car. locked together, both vehicles tumble down into
the ditch.
in the cabin of the truck max smashes the butt of the
shotgun into wez's face, again and again. wez just
grins.
86. the compound gate. day.
the prime mover thunders through the gate. pappagallo
and warrior woman take their positions on the
battlements...
as soon as the prime mover clears the gate big rebecca
plants her foot on the accelerator of the school
bus/gate. the lone wolf vehicle and the dune buggy just
make it inside.
the dog scampers through the rapidly closing gap.
a road racer slides up to the gate.
the driver looks up... to see pappagallo aiming the
flame thrower down at him... he slams the vehicle into
reverse...
87.
from the battlements looking out. day
pappagallo sends the torrent of flames down on the
retreating vehicle ... as humungus and the other
marauders hover at the entrance of the causeway ...
88.
inside the compound - the catwalk area. day.88.
the prime mover slides to a halt underneath a catwalk.
as several camp people run towards him, wez swings up
onto the roof of the prime mover and onto the catwalk.
the two marauder vehicles stop in the middle of the
compound.
max jumps out of the prime mover, assessing the
situation. in addition to wez there are four marauders
inside the compound: the lone wolf, the 'lone wolf's
passenger and two smegma crazies.
89.
the battlements. day.
under the direction of the humungus - half a dozen
marauders come surging up the causeway on foot.
pappagallo stands up on the very limit of the battlement
and scares them off with a burst of flame.
a marauder fires an arrow...
,..pappagallo is hit high up in the thigh. he tumbles
page 40/71backwards, off the parapet and crashes to the ground
below.
90.
inside the compound - the cracking tower. day.
up on the catwalk, wez is shouting at the four other
marauders.
wez:
the gate! the gate! move!!
max looks around as the lone wolf, the lone wolf
passenger and the two smegma crazies start to sprint
across the compound towards the gate ...
thud! the lone wolf passenger falls dead - an arrow in
his back...
wez spins around to see the quiet man standing on the
cooling tower reloading his bow.
wez starts running towards him.
91.
inside the compound. day.
with the help of the dog, max tackles the first smegma
crazy who is running towards the gate. they land at the
foot of the pump. the feral boy, bouncing up and down
on top of the pump looks down gleefully, as the farmer,
the butcher and the curmudgeon descend on the marauder.
max is on his feet running towards pappagallo, as the
second smegma crazy is bit by the mechanic flying on the
end of his lattice-arm contraption. angie and pismo,
manning the other end, smile with satisfaction.
92.
inside the compound - the cracking tower. day.
wez confronts the quiet man who has his bow drawn ...
the quiet man fires - wez ducks - missed!
wez grins. the quiet man is paralysed by indecision.
wez is on him... head-butts him - once, twice, three
times.
the quiet man's face is a torrent of blood as wez throws
him off the cooling platform.
the quiet man lands, groaning, badly injured.
93. from inside the bus. day.
the lone wolf has made it to the gate and smashes his
way through the window - clawing at big rebecca. she
shoves a boot in his face as warrior woman drops onto
him from the battlement above and buries a knife blade
in his neck.
94. at the battlements. day.
max has picked up pappagallo's flame thrower.
pappagallo watches as he climbs the battlements.
page 41/71a dozen marauders are charging up the causeway.
max appears above them... spraying fire. the marauders
retreat ...
95.
inside the compound. day.
wez grabs a cable and swings from the catwalk across the
cracking tower to pappagallo's 'dinosaur tent'. he
slides down the tent, leaps onto some tyres, onto a
storage tank and then onto the tanker...
he hesitates a moment looking for some way to get to the
gate ...
the whole camp turns to confront him...
he ducks, the gyrocopter swoops down over his head and
lands in the centre of the compound ...
an arrow, and then the feral kid's boomerang flies past
wez - ... he decides to call it quits.
running along the top of the tanker, be leaps the barbed
wire fence.
96. the ditch. day.
wez lands in the ditch.
he clambers over a wreck out of the ditch and out of
range.
97. inside the compound. the tanker. day.
the gyro captain is up on the tanker, throwing a stick
and shaking his fist at the marauders - putting on a
show for the jubilant compound people.
several people shake bands with the gyro captain.
the feral kid watches, puzzled, intrigued by this
strange ritual.
the mechanic is already examining the damage to the
prime mover.
pappagallo is propped up against the base of the
battlement. big rebecca and the warrior woman tend his
thigh wound.
pappagallo:
ok! ok! let's go. we leave
tonight!
the mechanic lifts his head out of the engine:
mechanic:
we got a hole through the radiator -
into the timing case. gonna take at
least 24 hours.
page 42/71pappagallo:
you've got twelve.
the crowd disperses.
the quiet man is carried to the bread van/medical
centre; the bodies are removed; camp members load
vehicles; men are working on the tanker.
warrior woman climbs onto the battlement.
98. the battlements. day.
the marauders have regrouped on the rise.
max is watching them, the flame thrower in his hands, as
the warrior woman approaches him:
warrior woman:
i want you to know... that was a
very brave thing you did...
he doesn't reply - just hands her the flame thrower and
descends the ladder.
99. inside the compound. day.
big rebecca has just pulled the arrow out of
pappagallo's legs. max moves into view.
pappagallo watches him walk towards the black-on -black
- it's nose poking out of the pyramid workshop.
as max passes the gyrocopter we see the gyro captain in
conversation with the curmudgeon.
curmudgeon:
... and tell me, son, this machine
of yours - it takes two ... does
it?
the gyro captain glances over the curmudgeon's shoulder
at lusty, who is admiring the gyrocopter.
gyro captain:
er... possibly.
the feral kid steps forward, holding his hand out
stiffly to max.
max hesitates, then shakes it briefly. the kid laughs -
he finds this hand shaking business hilarious.
as max moves on to the pyramid workshop, the feral kid
follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaking
stiff-legged gait.
100. int. pyramid workshop. late afternoon.
through the maze of pipes in the peak of the pyramid, we
have a high angle down on max working on the
page 43/71black-on-black below.
the feral kid comes into view in the foreground,
climbing along the pipes.
the kid is softly humming a tune - approximating the
first few notes of "happy birthday".
on the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfering
fuel from a 44 gallon drum into the black-on- black's
fuel tanks.
max is re-arming the booby traps - connecting a string
of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps. his utility
belt and jacket are off and he has laid his personal
effects on a nearby work bench.
in the background, through the arched doorway, we see
the mechanic and his team working on the truck with arc
welders, lights and so on.
max looks up:
the curmudgeon is leading pappagallo into the workshop.
curmudgeon:
see! i told ya. i said he was
leaving.
high up in the pyramid the feral kid starts to swing
down the pipes - towards the bench where max has laid
his jacket and utility belt. on the floor, pappagallo
confronts max:
pappagallo:
i don't have time for thanks. you
know what you did out there and what
it means to us. come with us, max.
drive the tanker.
max continues to work - muffling the four exhausts by
plugging them with rags.
max:
we had a contract. i did my job, i
got my car and i got my gas. end of
story.
pappagallo:
it doesn't have to be - we'll make a
new contract. i can offer you a
page 44/71chance to rebuild your life. i can
offer you a future.
the curmudgeon breaks in, excited.
curmudgeon:
you gotta come. look!
he produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which bears
the heading:
greetings from the
sunshine coast:
the feral kid's arm sneaks across the work bench
reaching out for the hurdy-gurdy.
max's hand snaps out and clamps around the kid's wrist.
the feral kid drops the hurdy-gurdy. as max releases
his grip the kid retreats into the shadows.
the curmudgeon unravels the postcard pictures in front
of max's face.
curmudgeon:
this is where we're going. two
thousand miles away. bloody
paradise. fresh water... plenty of
sunshine... nothing to do but
breed...
max starts to go back to his work.
pappagallo takes him by the shoulder.
pappagallo:
what are you looking for out there?
how long do you expect to survive,
scavenging day to day? you're no
different from them...
he points in the direction of the marauders ...
pappagallo:
... vultures, maggots. don't you
see? there is a better way!
max flares at him, angry:
max:
yeah. i tried it once! now forget
it, 'cos i never get involved. i'm
page 45/71leaving. i leave tonight.
pappagallo is about to reply when a scream echoes
through the camp.
they all turn to look: the men working on the prime
mover are running towards the battlement.
101.
inside the compound. the catwalk. dusk.
pappagalo climbs onto part of the refinery's catwalk
which is close to the workshop area.
several other camp members, including the gyro captain,
and lusty, are already there, looking across no man's
land.
the marauders are raising two tall poles.. two of the
camp members captured that morning are nailed to the
poles screaming.
pappagallo turns to max, who is still down at the
black-on-black.
pappagallo:
you see! that's the alternative!
men feeding on men.
max goes back to work.
the gyro captain slips his arm around lusty's shoulder.
gyro captain:
i know you're afraid darlin'... but
i'll let you into a secret,
sweetheart. i'm afraid too.
he squeezes her tight. she caresses his hand.
dissolve.
102.
no man's land. night.
silhouetted against a large fire, near the two poles, a
group of twelve marauders of various breeds beat out a
tattoo on the panels of their cars. the humungus
watches as two more victims are raised on poles. the
beat becomes more frenzied.
fade to black.
pouring with sweat, max tears up the first of a series
of metal plates which form the floor of the workshop
area.
he drags it.across the compound, passing the mechanicis
team working in a shower of sparks on the prime mover.
the mechanic looks up:
mechanic:
page 46/71co on! go! just another mercenary!
he spits.
max ignores him, dragging the plate past pappagallo's
tent. it is crowded with camp people, laying their
plans for escape.
they fall silent, turning to watch max.
104.
compound wall. bridge of cars. night.
the black-on-black waits next to the fence, near the
place where the mohawkers attempted to build the "bridge
of cars" across the ditch.
max has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is maneuvering
the metal plate on top of the first car - starting to
build a ramp from the compound, over the top of the cars
and onto the far side of the ditch.
dissolve.
105.
inside the compound. later that night.
the humungus has stepped up his theatrics of terror.
his voice booms across the night - reciting dark poetic
descriptions of death and hell.
the camp people, gathered in pappagallo's tent, watch as
the gyro captain walks towards the spot where max is
working. pappagallo sits at his desk, turning an egg
timer, the sand trickling from one end to the other.
106.
compound wall.
bridge of cars.
night.
max, who is locking the last metal plate into position,
looks up at the gyro captain.
gyro captain:
i just want you to know that i don't
agree with them.
he indicates the people in pappagallo's tent.
gyro captain:
i don't think you're a coward. a
bit stupid maybe - but not a coward.
where else you gonna find what we've
got here? food... fuel ... clean
women.
max goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to
the ramp.
gyro captain:
men, too, if that's your
inclination. jesus! all we've got
page 47/71to do is get away from that
humungus. with you driving the
tanker, we can do it! i know you
can. i saw you out there. stay
with us max. drive the tanker.
max gets up, shaking his head.
max:
i haven't got time to explain. just
believe me - i've got everything i
want.
the captain starts to interrupt but max cuts him short.
max:
good luck tomorrow. i hope you make
it.
max puts out his hand.
the captain, a little surprised, shakes hands with him.
gyro captain:
thanks. thanks a lot.
the captain walks back towards the group watching from
pappagallo's tent. he shrugs his shoulders.
max opens the door of the black-on-black.
107.
outside the compound. bridge of cars. night.
max eases the black car onto the metal plates.
the wide wheels rumble slowly across the makeshift
bridge.
max revs the motor to get over the last hump, the plugs
in the exhausts muffling the sound of the big engine.
the humungus's bizarre ravings continue to boom across
the wasteland.
106.
the wasteland near the compound.
night.
the black-on-black eases away from the compound.
the dog is edgy, growling. max takes hold of his
shotgun.
there is a thump! something lands on the roof.
the dog flies at the window snarling. max jams the
barrel against the roof.
a face appears, leaning over the windscreen, peering in
at max. it's the feral kid.
he grins and tumbles through the passenger's window.
he grabs hold of max's hand, shaking it.
the feral kid laughs, settling in to the seat.
page 48/71the car continues to roll forward.
max:
get out. scat! go back.
the feral kid looks at him, puzzled, then throws his
head back, howling.
max stops the car, looking around, nervous.
the first light of dawn appears on the horizon.
max turns to the feral kid:
max:
you're a fine kid, but you can't
come. you've gotta learn - don't
get close to people. it can churn
you up ...
the kid can't understand a word, so just grins.
max thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces
the hurdy-gurdy.
he shoves it into the feral kid's hands, opens the door
and pushes him out.
109.
the wasteland. dawn.
as the feral kid gets to his feet the black-on-black
accelerates away, surging up the rise towards the
humungus encampment.
the rapid burst of power fires the four plugs out of the
exhausts. the big engine roars.
110.
the rise above the compound. dawn.
wez springs to his feet. his face covered in a white
war paint. his eyes searching out the darkness. he
starts running... towards the humungus machine.
a gayboy berserker is running with him. as they climb
into the vehicle, the humungus - sitting on a rock near
the victims on the poles - gets to his feet.
he bellows with rage as wez drives the vehicle off in
pursuit of max. the two victims, still strapped to the
front, lift their heads.
111.
the humungus machine. dawn.
from the humungus machine wez sees six other vehicles
stream across the landscape in pursuit of the
black-on-black (one tow truck, two dune buggies, two
street cars and a bike).
the toadie emerges bewildered from where he has been
sleeping under the fuel tanks of the humungus machine.
112.
a road near the compound. dawn.
page 49/71the black-on-black achieves the road...
the dog is looking back through the passenger window as
we see the first of the pursuing vehicles rumble onto
the road ...
max hits the supercharger switch ...
the big engine whines up.
once again, the dog climbs down under the seat.
the humungus machine rockets onto the road... and
begins to overtake the other six marauder vehicles one
by one ...
wipe.
113.
the highway. early morning.
max is giving the black-on-black all its got ...
in the humungus machine wez, the gayboy berserker, and
the toadie have left the rest of the marauders well
behind ...
the big machine seems to be encroaching on the black-
on-black.
wez shouts instructions to the gayboy berserker who
comes to his side.
the gayboy berserker slides behind the wheel as wez
clambers forward onto the front of the vehicle.
the gayboy berserker reaches down. his hand rests on a
toggle switch next to three gas bottles marked:
nitrous oxide:
at the front of the vehicle wez grabs a huge exhaust
pipe jutting into the air. in spite of the heat, he
tears the pipe off the mounting. he signals to the
gayboy berserker.
the gayboy berserker flicks down the toggle switch:
there is a mighty roar matched by a massive surge of
power in the humungus machine...
the two victims on the front scream... max is
bewildered by the massive acceleration.
the humungus machine leaps alongside the black-on-black.
wez swings the chrome pipe down through the front
windscreen - into max's face.
114. a curve in the highway. morning.
the black-on-black takes out a guide post and leaves the
road ... rolling over and over.
inside the car max - his face bloodied - and the dog are
slammed around inside the cabin of the black-on-black.
it continues rolling, over and over again, into a
page 50/71gully...
115. the creek bed. morning.
what is left of the car comes to rest, upside down,
among the boulders of a dry creek bed. max is slumped,
dangling in his harness - his face and body bloodied and
broken. something moves ... it's the dog pulling
himself out of the wreckage. he licks and paws at max's
face. one eye flickers open.
116.
roadside.
morning.
wez stands looking down into the gully. another vehicle
has arrived. two gayboy berserkers and the toadie
scramble down towards the wreck carrying jerry cans.
wez:
don't waste him. if he's alive...
i want him.
117.
the creek bed. morning.
by an enormous force of will, max frees himself from the
harness and pulls himself through the window of the
wreck.
he falls to the ground, dragging his crippled body into
the shadow of a large boulder, hiding there.
the dog confronts the marauders, snarling, standing
between them and the wreck.
one of the gayboy berserkers rises his crossbow...
max watches, grim-faced, as the dog falls dead.
the three marauders run to the vehicle.
while the toadie prepares to siphon off the gas, the
other two peer into the crushed cabin.
perplexed, they examine the wreck more closely, looking
for max ...
one of them sees the drag marks, leading down the creek
bed.
he signals to the other marauder... max prepares to
defend himself ... the toadie prises the cap off the
black car's fuel tank.
the booby trap fizzles and explodes... the petrol
ignites... the three marauders are engulfed by a giant
fireball.
max looks past the flames, staring up at wez, not taking
his eyes off him...
118. roadside. morning.
wez and the other marauders watch the great pillar of
smoke rise up into the sky.
page 51/71they return to their vehicles.
119.
inside the compound. morning.
the gyro captain helps the lusty girl dismantle one of
the small tents.
in the background we see the camp vehicles standing
ready, fully loaded. the mechanic's team are still
working on the prime mover.
as pismo shouts from the tower, the gyro captain looks
up to see the smoke from the wreck rising into the sky.
the gyro captain mutters an oath and sprints towards his
machine.
120.
creek bed. day.
foot by foot, max drags himself along the creekbed
heading for the compound. blood seeps from wounds on
his head and face. his legs are useless, his hands
heavily bandaged with strips from his leather jacket.
behind him, in the distance, we see the still-
smouldering wreck of the black-on-black.
max struggles on, the pain growing, the sun climbing,
the temperature soaring. his mind becomes more
feverish; the wasteland dissolves into the heat haze;
the buzz of the flies around his face becomes the steady
drone of an engine.
the gyrocopter appears above him.
121.
on board the gyrocopter. day.
max, strapped to the chassis of the gyrocopter, drifts
back to consciousness.
he sees the compound surging towards them as they come
in to land.
he drifts back into unconsciousness, the images
distorting, dissolving...
122. inside the compound. the bread van. day.
max's eyes flicker open to a slow, distorted version of
"happy birthday".
as he fights to make sense of his surroundings, we see
that his wounds have been stitched and dressed.
he lifts his bead, looking through the back door of the
bread van.
pappagallo (v/o)
it's defensible. we can refuel
there.
125.
inside the compound. day.
max, grim-faced, starts to walk towards the tanker.
blood seeps through the bandage on his leg.
page 52/71pappagallo (v/o)
but! only give us until sunset. if
we haven't made it by then, keep
going!
pappagallo swings down off the catwalk, heading for the
cabin of the tanker.
the meeting breaks up - the camp people moving to take
up their positions on the various vehicles.
max:
i'll drive the tanker ...
everybody stops, turning to look at him.
max is staring at pappagallo, swaying slightly, hands
clenched.
max:
until you're clear of trouble ...
the curmudgeon breaks in:
curmudgeon:
he's gotta be joking!
pappagallo:
look at you.
max nods.
max:
but i'm still the best you've got.
pappagallo thinks for a long moment..
pappagallo:
you'll need these ...
he tosses max his sawn-off shotgun and a bandolier
containing six cartridges.
126. cracking tower. high angle. whole scene. day.
the tanker stands at the far end of the compound.
behind it, the gyro captain is spinning the rotor of his
machine.
a dune buggy and the lone wolf's car - armour-plated
since being captured by the camp - wait on either side
of the tanker.
beyond the gate the marauders have formed an arc of
vehicles just out of crossbow range. the humungus
machine stands at its centre.
page 53/71127.
inside the compound. day.
max sits in the tanker, checking out the controls,
familiarizing himself with the machine...
warrior woman stands on the running board.
she turns as the mechanic clambers on board. he glares
at her, daring her to stop him:
mechanic:
i sweated blood on this mother. and
no bastard's gonna make me go in no
lousy bread van.
max kicks over the big engine...
128.
outside the compound
wez stands on the back of a tow truck, beyond him. we
see the arc of vehicles, engines gunning, straining at
the leash ...
the humungus vehicle eases forward into frame ...
the two victims on the front of his vehicle have their
heads hooded.
129. inside the compound.
day.
max is revving the engine higher and higher.
warrior woman climbs up to the top of the tanker...
pappagallo starts the assault vehicle.
warrior woman finds the feral kid crouched down in her
position behind the protective plate. holding the kid
by his arm, she passes him down to max who passes him
down to the ground... pappagallo yells for someone to
come and take him...
the lusty girl runs forward... the feral kid avoids
her. max engages the engine. the tanker rumbles
forward, gathering speed as it runs the length of the
compound. big rebecca, at the wheel of the school bus,
draws the vehicle aside - revealing the burnt out wreck
of the road racer on the causeway and the marauders
beyond.
130. outside the compound. day.
the humungus has opened his gun case and removes the
magnum .44. the remaining 4 bullets have been placed in
the revolving chamber ...

inside the compound. day.
the dune buggy and the lone wolf machine follow close
behind the tanker.
the feral kid leaps onto the back of pappagallo's
vehicle.
page 54/71the warrior woman and the mechanic lie low as the tanker
roars out the gate, ploughing through the burnt out
wreck, knocking it into the ditch.
the humungus raises his gun, calmly taking aim at the
oncoming tanker...
as the tanker accelerates towards him, the gyrocopter
swoops out of the compound and over the marauders.
the gyro captain drops three burning molotov cocktails.
they fall in and around a road racer at one end of the
arc.... the road racer bursts into flames ...
the gyro captain whoops with delight.
132.
the break out. outside the compound. day.
with the lone wolf machine and the dune buggy close
alongside, max steers the tanker towards the burning
road racer.
the humungus fires ... once ...
the bullet dents the protective plate mounted on the
front of the tanker but does no further damage.
twice ... three times!
two more dents.
the tanker keeps going crashing through the burning
wreck ... breaking the marauders' cordon ...
133.
on board the gyrocopter. day.
the gyro captain has banked around and is swooping low.
having swung around, the gyro captain, swoops down,
taking aim on the humungus machine with another fistful
of lighted bottles.
the humungus looks up. he swings the revolver up,
taking aim at the approaching gyrocopter.
he fires!
the bullet hits, piercing the right rudder peddle.
dropping his bottles, the gyro captain screams and looks
down:
134. the rise outside the compound.
day
max glances up to see the gyrocopter, flying
erratically, swoop over and bank away towards the
horizon ...
on top of the tanker warrior woman and the mechanic
prepare to fire their weapons.
behind them, the humungus and his horde power over the
rise, pursuing the tanker.
suddenly, three of the marauder vehicles skid to a halt.
they start to turn back towards the compound, where the
page 55/71remaining camp vehicles are making their bid for
freedom.
the bread van and three other vehicles have followed the
yellow school bus out onto the causeway.
they skirt around the back of the compound and head off
across country.

the tanker! all on the tanker!
as the three marauder vehicles turn to rejoin the tanker
chase....whoomp! a massive flash fills the sky. the
camp erupts in flame, followed by a series of rolling
explosions.

135. dune buggy incident. highway. day.
as the tanker surges towards us, we see the dune buggy,
the lone wolf machine and the pursuing marauders,
surrounding it.
max grimaces as he changes gears. his leg is bleeding
freely now...
he looks to the passenger side:
the dune buggy, driven by the blacksmith and manned by
pismo, leaps onto the road in front of the tanker.
a tow truck, manned by skinheads, converges on it from
the driver's side.

crossbow... unaware that, behind him, wez's convertible
tow truck is approaching fast.

truck fires his crossbow...

arrow hits the second skinhead in the back of the head.

behind the tanker.

barely creased his scalp.

on the front of the tanker.

hand, turning over the motor.

in the tenth year, nurturing his
vision of a new world, he died
felling timber.
the lusty girl rolls her eyes and sighs as the gyro
captain draws alongside her window...

for years... together they raised
eight children.... and as for me...
the feral kid, sitting in the back of the bus, turns to
