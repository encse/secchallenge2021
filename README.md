# CrySyS Security Challenge 2021

Organized by the The Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS Lab) of 
Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

I collected my solutions here, mostly in python. I tried to automate as much as possible
but it doesn't always make sense, especially when it comes to the `reverse` or `misc` problems.

## Install and run 

```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python solve.py
```

It's also possible to filter by folders like:

```
> python solve.py secchallenge/web
```
